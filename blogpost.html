                <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
                <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews 
                    of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers. 
                </p>
                <img src="images/blog-hero.png">
                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours 
                    and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned 
                    or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>     
                <p>    
                    While that was fun, I felt 
                    like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about 
                    my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take 
                    notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my 
                    notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                    of what I learned using my own words. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, 
                    and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others 
                    learn and stay motivated.
